## Reflection
This project was created for a client but provided me with many learning opportunities. This site utilizes email.js for routing email from an HTML form. The nav is designed using custom CSS to create the illusion of blood dripping from it.

This project features the AOS (animate on scroll) library available here. https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

This project is built with React and React-Router.
