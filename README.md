Reflection
This project was created for me to practice and learn how to implement a dark theme in a react application. My solution to achieve this was to create two CSS color palates, one labeled 'darkmode' and add or remove that class from the body of the page using a javascript button. The state is then stored in local storage on your machine so your preference will be remembered next time you visit. Local storage is a safe way to store information on a machine as it transmits no data back to the server.

This project features the AOS (animate on scroll) library available here. https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

This project is built with React and React-Router.
